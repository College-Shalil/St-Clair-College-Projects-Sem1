I have developed a program which will calculate fines of a student. The fines will be different depending on the classification of the student.

-> First the user needs to enter the student number
-> Than the user should enter the speed limit
-> after that the user will enter the ticketed speed
-> Later on the user will enter the classification from the selection menu

Depending upon his classification the fines will be calculated and the fines for the user will be shown on the screen with a detailed information of the user.
