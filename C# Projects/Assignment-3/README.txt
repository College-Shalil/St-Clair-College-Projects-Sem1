I have developed a game named "Guess The Number". I have developed it in OOP manner.
First a welcome message will be diplayed, then the object is created for GuessTheNumber class. All the main code is written in the class.
Arraylist is used to store history and Random class is used to generate random number. Error handling is done throughout the code. Also System.Linq library is used to check whether the entered name is in string format.

Secondly, a menu method is created to diplay menu, which is added in constructor.
this menu method has a switch statement which is use to call other methods required for the program to work.

PlayMenu method - is an essential one which contains all the logic
History method - is used to display all the history of the users game
Exit method - is used to exit from the program.
